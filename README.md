# MWE for error in creating a PDF from a docusaurus documentation

## Project structure

I essentially created a new docusaurus project from scratch (`npx create-docusaurus@latest x classic`), deleted a few files and configurations, and added the papersaurus plugin.

## Reproduce

- install dependencies `npm i`
- run build `npm run build`
